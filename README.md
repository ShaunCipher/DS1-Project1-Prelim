Phase 1: Project Introduction &amp; Dashboard Design (Weeks 1–4)


Objectives:
- Define the main goal of the dashboard (e.g., monitor blood pressure trends over time, track daily food intake and nutritional balance).
- Identify the key metrics and KPIs to display (e.g., average BP per week, % of healthy readings, total calories per day, macro nutrient distribution).
- Determine the data sources (manual entry, CSV upload, API connection, IoT device readings).
- Sketch the dashboard layout — main sections, types of visualizations (charts, tables, gauges), and their arrangement.
- Describe user interaction features (filters, date range selectors, comparison views).

Deliverables:
- Dashboard wireframe/mockup (hand-drawn or using tools like Canva, Figma, or PowerPoint) showing the planned layout and components.
- Metrics & KPIs document listing each metric, its data source, and how it will be calculated.
- Visualization plan describing the type of chart or table for each metric and why it was chosen.
- User flow diagram showing how a user navigates and interacts with the dashboard.
